This repo contains the content for [https://didcomm.org](https://didcomm.org). The website is intended to be the world's nexus for all things DIDComm -- [the spec](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/), documentation, examples, and a global registry of protocol definitions.

### Contributing

The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) sponsors a [DIDComm Working Group](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html) that meets weekly (Mondays at 3 pm Eastern, 9 pm Central Europe, noon Pacific, 5 am Tokyo) to discuss all things DIDComm. The general public can listen in.
