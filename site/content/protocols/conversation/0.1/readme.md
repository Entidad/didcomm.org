## Roles

In addition to the `sender` and `receiver` roles defined in the BasicMessage protocol, this protocol introduces the `group-sender` role to denote that the agent sending the
conversation message is acting on behalf of a group of individuals representing a shared goal.

## Connectivity

The basic premise for a conversation protocol is that there is an expectation of at least one response message.
